- Summary:
- Project requirements clarified:
	- Single dashboard for complex building projects
	- Gantt chart as default view, with calendar and timeline view options
	- Image/PDF upload and association with Gantt bars (drag-and-drop)
	- Image viewer panel for associated images
	- Milestones, critical path, and project part hierarchy (phase > feature > item > part)
	- Project part attributes: name, duration, dependency, milestone, people, start date, notes, images, internal/external
	- Drag-and-drop Gantt bar editing (dates, durations, parent/child)
	- Color scheme: #FF8200 and #4B4B4B
	- Simple user management
	- Modern UI, always-visible header with two logos and vertical bar, watermark footer
	- Efficient, upgradeable file structure
- Project scaffolded: Created client and server directories, initialized package.json files, added basic starter files for both frontend and backend, and created a README.md.
- Next: Prioritize Gantt chart implementation as the main dashboard view, then proceed with calendar/timeline views, file upload, image association, and other UI components.
